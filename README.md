# PhotosSorter

PhotosSorter is a tool designed to help you organize and manage your photo collections efficiently. This repository contains the source code for the application.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and effective way to sort and categorize your photos. It is built to streamline the process of organizing large photo libraries.

## Current Limitation

At the moment, the application does not work directly from the browser. To use PhotosSorter, you need to:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the application locally on `localhost`.

I am working on improving the application to make it more accessible in the future.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions provided in the documentation.
